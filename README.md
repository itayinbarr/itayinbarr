# Hi there, I'm Itay Inbar 👋

If you're reading this, it means we have at least one common interest. Let's find which one!

## About Me

I'm passionate about exploring how our brains tick and how tech can tag along. Looking into how the brain works and mixing it with tech is my kind of adventure. I am dedicated to discovering ways technology and neuroscience can come together to unlock some of life’s mysteries.

My journey has been all about teamwork and creative problem-solving. Whether it's leading a project or brainstorming with buddies, I bring enthusiasm and a knack for breaking down complex ideas into fun, understandable bits.

I research at [Brains & Machines Lab](https://brainsandmachines.org/), and work at [i-BrainTech](http://www.i-brain.tech/).

### Education
- **B.Sc. Computational Neuroscience**
  - Ben Gurion University of the Negev (2021-2024)

#### Challenging Experience 
Our team achieved second place in a [competitive NASA AI contest](https://drivendata.co/blog/ai-assistants-winners), standing out among 300 teams. This experience was a testament to our collaborative innovation, problem-solving capabilities, and dedication.

#### Educational Experience 
I developed [interactive web simulators](https://neuropractical.web.app/eeg-simulator) intended to break down neuroscience concepts. These tools became engaging for students wanting to explore neuroscience in a practical way. This led to an unexpected opportunity: creating neuron model visualizations for an academic course, combining educational innovation with real-world application.

#### Dynamic Experience 
I led an [impact project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itayinbardev_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9A-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%9C-150000-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-activity-7068622939063017472-ix_B?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) that captured the attention of 150,000 users in 48 hours, merging legal education with user-friendly technology. This initiative demanded strong project management skills, effective communication, and a clear vision to deliver impactful solutions within tight deadlines.
