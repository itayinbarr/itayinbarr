# Hi there, I'm Itay Inbar 👋

### If you're reading this, it means we have at least one common interest. Let's find which one!

I'm passionate about exploring how our brains tick and how tech can tag along. Looking into how the brain works and mixing it with tech is my kind of adventure. I am dedicated to discovering ways technology and neuroscience can come together to unlock some of life’s mysteries.

My journey has been all about teamwork and creative problem-solving. Whether it's leading a project or brainstorming with buddies, I bring enthusiasm and a knack for breaking down complex ideas into fun, understandable bits.

#### I research at [Brains & Machines Lab](https://brainsandmachines.org/), work at [i-BrainTech](http://www.i-brain.tech/) and study computational neuroscience at BGU.


### Adventures

1. **NASA AI Contest:** Our team snagged second place in a [competitive NASA AI contest](https://drivendata.co/blog/ai-assistants-winners), standing out among 300 teams. This was a huge nod to our collaborative innovation and problem-solving skills.

2. **150K Users Project:** I spearheaded an [impact project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itayinbardev_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9A-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%9C-150000-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-activity-7068622939063017472-ix_B?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) that reached 150,000 users in 48 hours, blending legal education with user-friendly tech. This demanded strong project management, effective communication, and a clear vision to deliver impactful solutions quickly.

3. **Academic Neurosciennce Simulators:** I created [interactive web simulators](https://neuropractical.web.app/eeg-simulator) to make neuroscience concepts more engaging. This led to creating neuron model visualizations for an academic course, combining educational innovation with real-world application.
