Creating technology and connecting people.

Currently where neuroscience and technology meet.


### What I do

I use math and neurobiology to understand how the brain works.

- **Data Scientist** at [BRAIN.Q](https://brainqtech.com/), focused on analyzing neural signal processing in clinical settings to make technology better.

- **Researcher** at [Brains & Machines Lab](https://brainsandmachines.org/), using deep learning to learn how we perceive the world.


### Things I'm proud of

- **2nd place in a NASA AI research competition** - Won competing against 300 teams. Designed and built an AI system to answer NASA's challenge in research domains. [Read NASA's article about it](https://drivendata.co/blog/ai-assistants-winners)

- **Founded a neurotech community** – Dedicated to making neurotechnology tools more accessible to builders, founders, and other non-neuroscientists. Hundreds have joined. [Check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainHackersLab/)

- **Released open-source libraries** – Like [web-muse](https://github.com/itayinbarr/web-muse), which connects consumer EEG devices directly to the browser, allowing plug-and-play development.
